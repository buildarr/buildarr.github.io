Have you spent many hours getting your setup for one or more linked Sonarr/Radarr/Prowlarr instances just right, only to have no way to reproduce this setup apart from UI screenshots and database backups? Buildarr aims to alleviate those concerns by using a static configuration file to store settings for all your *Arr applications, and automatically configure them as defined. It can just once using an ad-hoc user command, or as a service to keep your application configurations up to date. Buildarr runs idempotently, only making changes to your instance if they are required. It can also automatically retrieve optimal configuration values from TRaSH-Guides for many things such as quality definitions and release profiles, so not only is there no need to manually input them into your configuration, Buildarr will also continually keep them up to date for you. Similar projects # Buildarr attempts to fulfill some of the needs of users of the following projects. Bobarr - An all-in-one package containing Sonarr, Radarr, Jackett etc Still requires manual configuration of many components, and there is no way to store the configuration as code. Flemmarr - Uses API parameters stored in YAML configuration files to push configuration changes to Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr etc Requires users to comprehensively learn how the APIs of each application work, going through often poor documentation. Since the values are machine-oriented, configuration files are difficult to write and understand. Does not support idempotent updates ( at this time ). Recyclarr - Automatically syncs recommended TRaSH-Guides settings to Sonarr/Radarr instances Buildarr has support for this built-in, and in the case of Sonarr release profiles, supports the same filtering syntax. Installation # Buildarr is available on Docker Hub as a Docker image. Plugins for Sonarr and Prowlarr are bundled into the official Docker container for Buildarr, so you can manage instances of those types right away. $ docker pull callum027/buildarr:latest Buildarr can also be installed using pip . Python 3.8 or later is required. Windows is natively supported. As of version 0.4.0, the Python package for Buildarr no longer includes plugins for applications. In order to use Buildarr to manage an application instance, you will also need to install its corresponding plugin. $ python3 -m venv buildarr-venv $ . buildarr-venv/bin/activate $ python3 -m pip install buildarr You can deploy Buildarr as a service within a Docker Compose environment, or use configuration management tools such as Ansible to automatically deploy it. For more information, check the installation instructions . Plugins # Buildarr supports external plugins to allow additional applications to be supported. At the time of this release the following plugins are available: buildarr-sonarr - Sonarr PVR for TV shows buildarr-prowlarr - Prowlarr indexer manager for Arr applications For more information on installing plugins, check the plugin documentation . Configuration # Buildarr uses YAML as its configuration file format. By default, Buildarr looks for buildarr.yml in the current directory. It contains not only the settings for Buildarr itself, but also the application instances to be managed. Multiple instances of the same application type can be defined (for example, a common use case would be separate Sonarr instances for HD TV shows, 4K TV shows, and anime). Any configuration on the remote instance not explicitly defined in the Buildarr configuration is not modified. For more information on how Buildarr uses configuration and how to configure Buildarr itself, check the configuration documentation . Here is an example of a simple Buildarr configuration that changes some settings on a Sonarr instance: --- # buildarr.yml # Buildarr example configuration file. # Buildarr configuration (all settings have sane default values) buildarr : watch_config : true update_days : - \"monday\" - \"tuesday\" - \"wednesday\" - \"thursday\" - \"friday\" - \"saturday\" - \"sunday\" update_times : - \"03:00\" # Sonarr instance configuration sonarr : hostname : \"localhost\" port : 8989 protocol : \"http\" settings : # General settings (all options supported except for changing the API key) general : host : instance_name : \"Sonarr (Buildarr Example)\" If you have an already configured application instance, its configuration can be dumped. For example, to get the configuration of a Sonarr instance, this can be done using the following command (Buildarr will prompt for your API key): $ docker run -it --rm callum027/buildarr:latest sonarr dump-config http://sonarr.example.com:8989 Once you have this configuration, you can insert it into buildarr.yml and ensure this configuration is maintained. Running Buildarr # Once you have a valid configuration file, you can try Buildarr on your local machine using the Docker image. The following command will mount the current folder into the Docker container so buildarr.yml can be read, and start Buildarr in daemon mode. $ docker run -d --name buildarr -v $( pwd ) :/config -e PUID = $( id -u ) -e PGID = $( id -g ) callum027/buildarr:latest If installed using pip , simply run the buildarr CLI command. $ buildarr daemon On startup, Buildarr daemon will do an initial sync with the defined instances, updating their configuration immediately. After this initial run, Buildarr will wake up at the scheduled times to periodically run updates as required. 2023-03-29 20:40:39,958 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Buildarr version 0.4.0 (log level: INFO) 2023-03-29 20:40:39,958 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Loading configuration file '/config/buildarr.yml' 2023-03-29 20:40:39,977 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Finished loading configuration file 2023-03-29 20:40:39,977 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Daemon configuration: 2023-03-29 20:40:39,978 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Watch configuration files: Yes 2023-03-29 20:40:39,978 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Configuration files to watch: 2023-03-29 20:40:39,978 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - /config/buildarr.yml 2023-03-29 20:40:39,978 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Update at: 2023-03-29 20:40:39,978 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Monday 03:00 2023-03-29 20:40:39,979 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Tuesday 03:00 2023-03-29 20:40:39,979 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Wednesday 03:00 2023-03-29 20:40:39,979 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Thursday 03:00 2023-03-29 20:40:39,979 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Friday 03:00 2023-03-29 20:40:39,979 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Saturday 03:00 2023-03-29 20:40:39,979 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] - Sunday 03:00 2023-03-29 20:40:39,979 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Applying initial configuration 2023-03-29 20:40:39,981 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Loaded plugins: sonarr (0.4.0) 2023-03-29 20:40:39,981 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Loading instance configurations 2023-03-29 20:40:39,983 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished loading instance configurations 2023-03-29 20:40:39,983 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Running with plugins: sonarr 2023-03-29 20:40:39,983 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Resolving instance dependencies 2023-03-29 20:40:39,984 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished resolving instance dependencies 2023-03-29 20:40:39,984 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Loading secrets file from '/config/secrets.json' 2023-03-29 20:40:39,989 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished loading secrets file 2023-03-29 20:40:39,989 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <sonarr> (default) Checking secrets 2023-03-29 20:40:40,015 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <sonarr> (default) Connection test successful using cached secrets 2023-03-29 20:40:40,015 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <sonarr> (default) Finished checking secrets 2023-03-29 20:40:40,015 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Saving updated secrets file to '/config/secrets.json' 2023-03-29 20:40:40,017 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished saving updated secrets file 2023-03-29 20:40:40,017 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Updating configuration on remote instances 2023-03-29 20:40:40,017 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <sonarr> (default) Getting remote configuration 2023-03-29 20:40:40,599 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <sonarr> (default) Finished getting remote configuration 2023-03-29 20:40:40,662 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <sonarr> (default) Updating remote configuration 2023-03-29 20:40:41,129 buildarr:1 buildarr.config.base [INFO] <sonarr> (default) sonarr.settings.general.host.instance_name: 'Sonarr' -> 'Sonarr (Buildarr Example)' 2023-03-29 20:40:41,204 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <sonarr> (default) Remote configuration successfully updated 2023-03-29 20:40:41,204 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <sonarr> (default) Finished updating remote configuration 2023-03-29 20:40:41,205 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished updating configuration on remote instances 2023-03-29 20:40:41,205 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Finished applying initial configuration 2023-03-29 20:40:41,205 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Scheduling update jobs 2023-03-29 20:40:41,206 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Finished scheduling update jobs 2023-03-29 20:40:41,206 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] The next run will be at 2023-03-30 03:00 2023-03-29 20:40:41,206 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Setting up config file monitoring 2023-03-29 20:40:41,216 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Finished setting up config file monitoring 2023-03-29 20:40:41,216 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Setting up signal handlers 2023-03-29 20:40:41,216 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Finished setting up signal handlers 2023-03-29 20:40:41,216 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.daemon [INFO] Buildarr ready.

The main changes are behind-the-scenes improvements to the plugin API. Plugins will need to be updated to support this new version. Due to requiring more work than anticipated to keep working, the deprecated --dry-run option has been removed from the buildarr run command. If you require more testing for your configuration than buildarr test-config does, it is recommended to create a staging environment for your Arr stack, and test configuration changes against that. The following issues have also been addressed: Added a new request_timeout global state attribute, which provides a valid value even when the Buildarr configuration is not loaded (e.g. plugin-specific ad-hoc commands). This allows plugins to fix an issue where when dumping instance configurations, they were trying to access the corresponding attribute in the Buildarr config, which isn't loaded for that command. Added # Add request_timeout global state attribute ( #114 ) Changed # Set validate_assignment to True by default for config models ( #115 ) Change ConfigBase.uses_trash_metadata to a function ( #116 ) Removed # Remove deprecated features for Buildarr v0.5.0 ( #112 ) Remove the deprecated ad-hoc run --dry-run option ( #113 ) v0.4.2 - 2023-04-14 # This is a backwards-compatible feature and bugfix release. This release mainly introduces new behind-the-scenes plugin API functionality to accommodate for new Buildarr plugins currently in development. Add a new generic rendering stage to Buildarr runs for populating dynamic configuration attributes (e.g. TRaSH-Guides metadata), that is not specific to TRaSH-Guides metadata. The current TRaSH-Guides metadata rendering function is now deprecated, and scheduled to be removed in Buildarr v0.5.0. Add a new stage to Buildarr runs for initialising new instances (e.g. with admin credentials or environment settings), that runs after rendering dynamic configuration attributes, but before secrets or remote configuration fetching takes place. This is intended to be used if an application requires initialising before the main API can be used by Buildarr, even before secrets metadata can be checked/fetched. Add a new stage to Buildarr runs for deleting resources from the remote instance if they are not managed by Buildarr or unused, and deletion is allowed in the configuration. This runs after the main configuration update stage, and improves stability of resource deletions by performing them in the reverse instance dependency order, ensuring resources that require resources on another instance are removed first. Any plugins that perform resource deletions are expected to move this functionality to this new Buildarr run stage. Some bugs that are likely to be encountered when setting up a complex Arr stack with linked instances have also been fixed: Partially fix an issue where attributes of the integer enumeration type ( BaseIntEnum ) were not properly handled, resulting in strange logging and potentially validation errors. Since it is not feasible to fully resolve the issue, the BaseIntEnum type is now deprecated, and scheduled to be removed in Buildarr v0.5.0. Allow the default instance of an application plugin (a configuration specified without using instances: ) to be referenced in instance links, by specifying the reserved default instance name. A validation check has been added to disallow the user from defining an instance-specific configuration named default , as that is now (and always has been) a reserved name with respect to instance names in Buildarr. Fix an issue where some non-empty data structure types were not evaluated properly when reading the active configuration of a remote instance, resulting in a Buildarr internal error. Added # Add Buildarr run stage for initialising new instances ( #99 ) Add generic configuration rendering stage ( #101 ) Add resource deletion stage after configuration updates ( #102 ) Changed # Deprecate BaseIntEnum ( #95 ) Allow the default instance to be used in instance links ( #98 ) Update development dependencies ( #103 ) Fix default config attribute decoder type discovery ( #105 ) Delete resources using the reverse execution order ( #106 ) v0.4.1 - 2023-04-09 # This is a backwards-compatible feature and bugfix release that resolves some issues when running Buildarr in a Docker container, and other small bugs. A bug was fixed where Buildarr would not always detect configuration file changes in the Docker environment, particularly if run in Docker Desktop or Docker on WSL2. The default settings for the YAML encoder for configurations were adjusted, changing the configuration attribute order to be closer to the intended order, and making automatically generated configuration easier to read. The documentation has been updated to note the release of the Prowlarr plugin for Buildarr , and the installation instructions for the Docker image have been extended to reflect changes in the way the Docker container can be used. The plugin API has been extended to add a hook for overriding the function that Buildarr uses to compare local and remote configuration attribute values, for when custom code for that is required. Added # Add overriding the value compare function to remote maps ( #84 ) Changed # Fix config file monitoring in the Docker container ( #82 ) Fix mistakes in error messages ( #85 ) Update Buildarr docs ( #87 ) Improve built-in YAML encoding ( #88 ) v0.4.0 - 2023-03-31 # This is a semi backwards-incompatible feature and bugfix release that undertakes large refactors to move Buildarr closer to the final form it will take for stable release. As major strides have been taken to stabilise the plugin API, the Sonarr plugin for Buildarr has been forked into a separate package, buildarr-sonarr . From this version onwards, Buildarr no longer bundles application plugins. The Docker container still bundles the Sonarr plugin for ease of use, but when upgrading an existing standalone installation of Buildarr, the Sonarr plugin package will need to be installed using pip . $ pip install buildarr-sonarr This will allow the Sonarr plugin to deliver releases independently of the base Buildarr package, allowing for more rapid releases of both packages, while ensuring compability between Buildarr and its plugins through plugin version pinning of the Buildarr base package. Buildarr uses semantic versioning . While Buildarr is in beta, point releases (e.g. 0.x.0 ) signify there may be a breaking change to the plugin API, which plugins should accommodate with corresponding changes and adjustment of their dependency requirements. After Buildarr releases its first stable version ( v1.0.0 ), major version increases (e.g. v2.0.0 ) will be used for backward-incompatible releases, while point releases (e.g. v1.x.0 ) will be made for backward-compatible feature releases. A number of other features and bugfixes have been added in this release: Add support for dry runs in Buildarr ad-hoc runs, for testing configuration changes against live instances without modifying them Add configuration validity testing using the buildarr test-config command Add support for overriding the secrets file path using the --secrets-file option Add automatic generation of Docker Compose files from Buildarr configuration files using the buildarr compose command Improve configuration parsing so that local relative paths read by Buildarr are resolved relative to the parent directory of the file the attribute was read from, rather than the current directory of the Buildarr process Improve validation to output easier-to-read error messages in some cases Improve logging so that it is clearer what source file the log message came from, and what plugin and instance name the message relates to Relax Buildarr base package dependency version requirements, for improved compatibility with external plugins Added # Add the --dry-run option to buildarr run ( #56 ) Add instance-specific configs to global state and fix Sonarr dry-run bug ( #59 ) Add the buildarr test-config command ( #60 ) Add --secrets-file option to daemon and run modes ( #67 ) Add the buildarr compose command ( #73 ) Reintroduce buildarr.__version__ and use it internally ( #75 ) Add version attribute to plugin metadata object ( #78 ) Changed # Convert most root validators to attribute-specific validators ( #54 ) Remove unused code and fix pre-commit job ( #58 ) Enable validating default config/secrets attribute values ( #63 ) Reduce usage of initialize.js endpoints ( #66 ) Refactor logging infrastructure ( #68 ) Relax dependency version requirements ( #69 ) Improve and add missing docs for new features ( #70 ) Evaluate local paths relative to the config file ( #71 ) Add temporary ignore for watchdog.Observer type hint ( #72 ) Fork the Sonarr plugin into its own package ( #76 ) v0.3.0 - 2023-03-15 # This is a feature and bugfix release that extends the groundwork laid in the previous version for making Buildarr more usable, and future-proof for the planned new plugins. A major bug where running Buildarr when secrets.json does not exist would result in an error, even if valid instance credentials were found, has been fixed. This would have prevented many people from trying out Buildarr, and for this I would like to apologise. In the future automated unit tests are planned, and major refactors of the Buildarr codebase are now less likely to happen as a result of development, so bugs like this should not happen as often in the future. The major new feature this release introduces is instance linking: the ability to define relationships between two instances. Most of the work went into the internal implementation to make it possible to use in plugins, but one use case within the Sonarr plugin itself is now supported: Sonarr instances using another Sonarr instance as an import list, via the new instance_name attribute. When using this attribute, Buildarr will automatically fill in the API key attribute so you don't have to, and instead of using IDs to reference quality profiles/language profiles/tags in the source instance, names can now be used: sonarr : instances : sonarr-hd : hostname : \"localhost\" port : 8989 sonarr-4k : hostname : \"localhost\" port : 8990 settings : import_lists : definitions : Sonarr (HD) : type : \"sonarr\" # Global import list options. root_folder : \"/path/to/videos\" quality_profile : \"4K\" language_profile : \"English\" # Sonarr import list-specific options. full_url : \"http://sonarr:8989\" instance_name : \"sonarr-hd\" source_quality_profiles : - \"HD/SD\" source_language_profiles : - \"English\" source_tags : - \"shows\" When instance links are made, Buildarr automatically adjusts the order of execution such that the target instance is always processed before the instance linking to the target. This ensures the state of the target instance is consistent when they are both updated to establish the link. A number of other improvements and bugfixes were made, such as: Fix configuration validation to allow local and non-qualified domains on all URL-type attributes (fixes localhost API URL references) Rename the following Sonarr import list attributes (and retain the old names as aliases to ensure backwards compatibility): source_quality_profile_ids renamed to source_quality_profiles source_language_profile_ids renamed to source_language_profiles source_tag_ids renamed to source_tags Fix reading the $BUILDARR_LOG_LEVEL environment variable to be case-insensitive Clean up runtime state after individual update runs in daemon mode, to ensure no state leakage into subsequent runs Add a new buildarr.request_timeout configuration attribute for adjusting API request timeouts (the default is 30 seconds) Improve Sonarr quality definition min and max validation so that 400 is also a valid value for max , and enforce min - max value difference constraints Major internal code refactor through the introduction of Ruff to the development pipeline, fixing a large number of minor code quality issues Changed # Fix fetching new instance secrets ( #44 ) Accept local and non-qualified domain names in URLs ( #46 ) Add instance referencing and dependency resolution ( #47 ) Replace isort and Flake8 with Ruff and reformat source files ( #49 ) v0.2.0 - 2023-02-23 # This is a feature release that comprehensively refactors the internal structure of Buildarr and the plugin API, and introduces a new, formally defined global state architecture that Buildarr and plugins can utilise. These changes improve maintainability of the codebase, allow for more accurate type validation of global state objects, make the plugin API easier to understand for developers, and pave the way for planned new features such as configuring instance-to-instance links within Buildarr. This release also introduces connection testing of cached and auto-retrieved instance secrets, to ensure Buildarr can communicate and authenticate with instances before it tries to update them. A handful of bugs were fixed, including but not limited to: Work around a parsing bug in Pydantic that causes Buildarr to error out when specifying Sonarr instance API keys in the Buildarr configuration More accurate resource type detection eliminating the chance of parsing errors for Sonarr import list, indexer, download client and connection definitions Set better constraints on some Sonarr configuration attributes: To handle suboptimal configuration (e.g. ignore duplicate elements) To reject invalid configuration (e.g. require at least one recipient e-mail address on Mailgun and Sendgrid connection types) Added # Implement testing of cached and fetched instance secrets ( #32 ) Refactor the internals of Buildarr to improve maintainability ( #30 ) Changed # Convert Password and SonarrApiKey to subclasses of SecretStr ( #34 ) Fix CLI exception class inheritance ( #35 ) Use discriminated unions to accurately determine resource type ( #36 ) Change log types of some TRaSH logs to INFO ( #37 ) Set better constraints on Sonarr configuration attributes ( #38 ) v0.1.2 - 2023-02-20 # This is a bugfix release that fixes updates of certain types of Sonarr instance configuration, improving usability of the Sonarr plugin. The following types of Sonarr instance configuration have had bugfixes and improvements made, and are confirmed to work without errors: Media Management Ensure that minimum_free_space is set to a minimum of 100 MB Fix unmonitor_deleted_episodes so that it is now checked and updated by Buildarr Add a delete_unmanaged_root_folders option to allow Buildarr to delete undefined root folders (disabled by default) Improve other configuration constraints so that it more closely matches Sonarr Fix a minor logging bug in root folder updates Profiles Quality Profiles / Language Profiles Improve attribute constraints e.g. ensure duplicate quality values cannot be defined, enforce upgrade_until being required when allow_upgrades is True Fix conversion between Buildarr and Sonarr configuration state so that no errors occur when upgrades are disabled Internal refactor to make the code easier to understand Delay Profiles - Confirmed to work properly as of v0.1.1 (and likely v0.1.0 ) Release Profiles Fix bug introduced in v0.1.1 where internal validation is not done on release profiles downloaded from TRaSH-Guides, resulting in preferred word lists being updated on each run, and potential errors not being caught if there are invalid values in the profile Internal refactor to simplify implementation Quality Fix bug introduced in v0.1.1 where internal validation is not done on quality profiles downloaded from TRaSH-Guides, resulting in potential errors not being caught if there are invalid values in the profile Metadata - Confirmed to work properly as of v0.1.1 (and likely v0.1.0 ) Small logging bug fixed where it was ambiguous which metadata type was being modified on update Tags - Confirmed to work properly as of v0.1.1 (and likely v0.1.0 ) General Improve behaviour when setting an authentication username and password so that configuration updates are idempotent when authentication is disabled Fix setting a proxy password Fix setting backup intervals and retentions so that it is no longer possible to set a value not supported by Sonarr Incorrect syntax in some examples in the documentation were also found and fixed.

The main changes are behind-the-scenes improvements to the plugin API. Plugins will need to be updated to support this new version. Due to requiring more work than anticipated to keep working, the deprecated --dry-run option has been removed from the buildarr run command. If you require more testing for your configuration than buildarr test-config does, it is recommended to create a staging environment for your Arr stack, and test configuration changes against that. The following issues have also been addressed: Added a new request_timeout global state attribute, which provides a valid value even when the Buildarr configuration is not loaded (e.g. plugin-specific ad-hoc commands). This allows plugins to fix an issue where when dumping instance configurations, they were trying to access the corresponding attribute in the Buildarr config, which isn't loaded for that command.","title":"v0.5.0 - 2023-04-16"},{"location":"release-notes/#added","text":"Add request_timeout global state attribute ( #114 )","title":"Added"},{"location":"release-notes/#changed","text":"Set validate_assignment to True by default for config models ( #115 ) Change ConfigBase.uses_trash_metadata to a function ( #116 )","title":"Changed"},{"location":"release-notes/#removed","text":"Remove deprecated features for Buildarr v0.5.0 ( #112 ) Remove the deprecated ad-hoc run --dry-run option ( #113 )","title":"Removed"},{"location":"release-notes/#v042-2023-04-14","text":"This is a backwards-compatible feature and bugfix release. This release mainly introduces new behind-the-scenes plugin API functionality to accommodate for new Buildarr plugins currently in development. Add a new generic rendering stage to Buildarr runs for populating dynamic configuration attributes (e.g. TRaSH-Guides metadata), that is not specific to TRaSH-Guides metadata. The current TRaSH-Guides metadata rendering function is now deprecated, and scheduled to be removed in Buildarr v0.5.0. Add a new stage to Buildarr runs for initialising new instances (e.g. with admin credentials or environment settings), that runs after rendering dynamic configuration attributes, but before secrets or remote configuration fetching takes place. This is intended to be used if an application requires initialising before the main API can be used by Buildarr, even before secrets metadata can be checked/fetched. Add a new stage to Buildarr runs for deleting resources from the remote instance if they are not managed by Buildarr or unused, and deletion is allowed in the configuration. This runs after the main configuration update stage, and improves stability of resource deletions by performing them in the reverse instance dependency order, ensuring resources that require resources on another instance are removed first. Any plugins that perform resource deletions are expected to move this functionality to this new Buildarr run stage. Some bugs that are likely to be encountered when setting up a complex Arr stack with linked instances have also been fixed: Partially fix an issue where attributes of the integer enumeration type ( BaseIntEnum ) were not properly handled, resulting in strange logging and potentially validation errors. Since it is not feasible to fully resolve the issue, the BaseIntEnum type is now deprecated, and scheduled to be removed in Buildarr v0.5.0. Allow the default instance of an application plugin (a configuration specified without using instances: ) to be referenced in instance links, by specifying the reserved default instance name. A validation check has been added to disallow the user from defining an instance-specific configuration named default , as that is now (and always has been) a reserved name with respect to instance names in Buildarr. Fix an issue where some non-empty data structure types were not evaluated properly when reading the active configuration of a remote instance, resulting in a Buildarr internal error.","title":"v0.4.2 - 2023-04-14"},{"location":"release-notes/#added_1","text":"Add Buildarr run stage for initialising new instances ( #99 ) Add generic configuration rendering stage ( #101 ) Add resource deletion stage after configuration updates ( #102 )","title":"Added"},{"location":"release-notes/#changed_1","text":"Deprecate BaseIntEnum ( #95 ) Allow the default instance to be used in instance links ( #98 ) Update development dependencies ( #103 ) Fix default config attribute decoder type discovery ( #105 ) Delete resources using the reverse execution order ( #106 )","title":"Changed"},{"location":"release-notes/#v041-2023-04-09","text":"This is a backwards-compatible feature and bugfix release that resolves some issues when running Buildarr in a Docker container, and other small bugs.

The default settings for the YAML encoder for configurations were adjusted, changing the configuration attribute order to be closer to the intended order, and making automatically generated configuration easier to read. The documentation has been updated to note the release of the Prowlarr plugin for Buildarr , and the installation instructions for the Docker image have been extended to reflect changes in the way the Docker container can be used.

As major strides have been taken to stabilise the plugin API, the Sonarr plugin for Buildarr has been forked into a separate package, buildarr-sonarr . From this version onwards, Buildarr no longer bundles application plugins. The Docker container still bundles the Sonarr plugin for ease of use, but when upgrading an existing standalone installation of Buildarr, the Sonarr plugin package will need to be installed using pip . $ pip install buildarr-sonarr This will allow the Sonarr plugin to deliver releases independently of the base Buildarr package, allowing for more rapid releases of both packages, while ensuring compability between Buildarr and its plugins through plugin version pinning of the Buildarr base package.

Generating a Docker Compose file # New in version 0.4.0. This is an ad-hoc command that can be used to automatically generate a Docker Compose file from a given Buildarr configuration file. The generated Docker Compose file is guaranteed to have: Image tags matching the instance versions defined in the Buildarr configuration file Restart policy set on all services Any required volumes created Service dependencies added based on instance-to-instance links present in the Buildarr configuration Buildarr itself added as a service in daemon mode, to deploy instance configurations and keep them up to date The resulting file will be relatively basic and might require some additional changes to suit your environment, but it should provide a good starting point for setting up automatic deployment and configuration of your *Arr stack. Note There are a few additional limitations on the instance configurations, on top of Buildarr's regular constraints: Instance hostnames must not be set to IP addresses. All instances must have unique hostnames, unless the --ignore-hostnames option is set. Given the following example Buildarr configuration file, located at /opt/buildarr/buildarr.yml : --- sonarr : instances : sonarr-hd : {} sonarr-4k : settings : media_management : root_folders : - /tmp/videos profiles : language_profiles : definitions : English : languages : - \"English\" import_lists : definitions : \"Sonarr (HD)\" : type : \"sonarr\" root_folder : \"/tmp/videos\" quality_profile : \"Any\" language_profile : \"English\" full_url : \"http://sonarr-hd:8989\" instance_name : \"sonarr-hd\" We can use the following command to create a corresponding Docker Compose file. $ buildarr compose /opt/buildarr/buildarr.yml > /opt/buildarr/docker-compose.yml The resulting file located at /opt/buildarr/docker-compose.yml will look like this: --- version : '3.7' services : sonarr_sonarr-hd : image : lscr.io/linuxserver/sonarr:latest volumes : sonarr_sonarr-hd : /config hostname : sonarr-hd restart : always sonarr_sonarr-4k : image : lscr.io/linuxserver/sonarr:latest volumes : sonarr_sonarr-4k : /config hostname : sonarr-4k restart : always depends_on : - sonarr_sonarr-hd buildarr : image : callum027/buildarr:0.4.0 command : - daemon - /config/buildarr.yml volumes : - type : bind source : /opt/buildarr target : /config restart : always depends_on : - sonarr_sonarr-hd - sonarr_sonarr-4k volumes : - sonarr_sonarr-4k - sonarr_sonarr-hd Plugin-specific commands # Plugins can implement their own ad-hoc commands.

For more information, refer to the user guide for the respective plugin.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#using-buildarr","text":"Apart from the configuration, most of the interactions with Buildarr are done via the command line. The following commands are available for Buildarr: buildarr run - Manually perform an update run on one or more instances and exit buildarr daemon - Run Buildarr forever: perform an initial update run, and then schedule periodic updates buildarr test-config - Test a configuration file for correctness ( New in version 0.4.0 ) buildarr compose - Generate a Docker Compose file from Buildarr configuration ( New in version 0.4.0 ) buildarr <plugin-name> <command...> - Ad-hoc commands defined by any loaded plugins Note Every time Buildarr performs an update run, a file named secrets.json is created in the folder the configuration file is located. This file caches secrets metadata for every configured instance. Ensure that the Buildarr configuration is located in a folder that is not world-viewable, to avoid exposing secrets. If you are using Docker, ensure that the folder mounted as /config into the container has appropriately secure permissions. The location of secrets.json can be configured using the --secrets-file command line option, or the buildarr.secrets_file_path attribute in the configuration file. The verbosity of Buildarr logging output can be adjusted using the --log-level option. This option can also be set using the $BUILDARR_LOG_LEVEL environment variable.

Note There are a few additional limitations on the instance configurations, on top of Buildarr's regular constraints: Instance hostnames must not be set to IP addresses. All instances must have unique hostnames, unless the --ignore-hostnames option is set.

Jellyseerr is an application that links with both Jellyfin/Plex and your Sonarr/Radarr instances. It allows your users to login using their Jellyfin/Plex credentials, browse available media online, and make media requests for new content. Once these requests are approved, Jellyseerr will then make the requests to Sonarr/Radarr to download them, monitor the progress, and report back to the user when the media is available in Jellyfin/Plex. Buildarr can be used to initialise a new Jellyseerr install with Jellyfin server credentials (Plex is not supported at this time), manage the Jellyseerr server settings, and connect it with Sonarr and Radarr servers. Installation # When using Buildarr as a standalone application , the Jellyseerr plugin can simply be installed using pip : $ pip install buildarr buildarr-jellyseerr If you are linking a Jellyseerr instance with another Buildarr-configured Sonarr instance, use the sonarr extra to also install a compatible version of the Sonarr plugin. $ pip install buildarr buildarr-jellyseerr [ sonarr ] When using Buildarr as a Docker container , the Jellyseerr plugin is bundled with the official container ( callum027/buildarr ), so there is no need to install it separately. You can upgrade or pin the version of the plugin to a specific version within the container by setting the $BUILDARR_JELLYSEERR_VERSION environment variable in the docker run command using --env / -e : -e BUILDARR_JELLYSEERR_VERSION = \"<version>\" Quick Start # Brand new Jellyseerr instances require initialisation for Buildarr to be able to manage it. This is usually done manually by navigating to http://localhost:5055/setup on the Jellyseerr host, logging in with Jellyfin or Plex credentials, and then selecting libraries to monitor. As of this release, automatically initialising Jellyseerr for Plex is not yet supported. Please initialise the Jellyseerr instance manually. For Jellyseerr instances being connected to Jellyfin only, Buildarr can perform this initialisation automatically. To do this, set the following parameters under the jellyfin configuration section, which are required when initialisting a new instance (they are otherwise optional): --- jellyseerr : hostname : \"localhost\" port : 5055 protocol : \"http\" api_key : \"<API key>\" # Required. Check `settings.json` in the config volume to get the value. settings : jellyfin : server_url : \"http://localhost:8096\" # Jellyfin server URL, preferably direct (no proxy). username : \"admin\" # Jellyfin server admin user. password : \"secure-password\" # Jellyfin server admin user password. email_address : \"admin@example.com\" # Jellyfin server admin email address. # Jellyfin media libraries to monitor. # This can be used to change what libraries Jellyseerr monitors, # even after it is initialised. libraries : - \"Shows\" - \"Movies\" - \"Anime\" - \"Anime Movies\" After that, configure and run Buildarr as normal, and setup desired settings for Jellyseerr. For more information on configuring Jellyseerr, see Configuring your Jellyseerr instance . Once you have a complete configuration file, test it against the Jellyseerr instance using buildarr run . The output should contain messages about checking, performing and finishing the initialisation. If no errors were found, congratulations, your Jellyseerr instance is now managed by Buildarr! 2023-04-15 09:44:20,386 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Buildarr version 0.4.2 (log level: INFO)

Jellyseerr is an application that links with both Jellyfin/Plex and your Sonarr/Radarr instances. It allows your users to login using their Jellyfin/Plex credentials, browse available media online, and make media requests for new content. Once these requests are approved, Jellyseerr will then make the requests to Sonarr/Radarr to download them, monitor the progress, and report back to the user when the media is available in Jellyfin/Plex. Buildarr can be used to initialise a new Jellyseerr install with Jellyfin server credentials (Plex is not supported at this time), manage the Jellyseerr server settings, and connect it with Sonarr and Radarr servers.","title":"Buildarr Jellyseerr Plugin"},{"location":"plugins/jellyseerr/#installation","text":"When using Buildarr as a standalone application , the Jellyseerr plugin can simply be installed using pip : $ pip install buildarr buildarr-jellyseerr If you are linking a Jellyseerr instance with another Buildarr-configured Sonarr instance, use the sonarr extra to also install a compatible version of the Sonarr plugin. $ pip install buildarr buildarr-jellyseerr [ sonarr ] When using Buildarr as a Docker container , the Jellyseerr plugin is bundled with the official container ( callum027/buildarr ), so there is no need to install it separately. You can upgrade or pin the version of the plugin to a specific version within the container by setting the $BUILDARR_JELLYSEERR_VERSION environment variable in the docker run command using --env / -e : -e BUILDARR_JELLYSEERR_VERSION = \"<version>\"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"plugins/jellyseerr/#quick-start","text":"Brand new Jellyseerr instances require initialisation for Buildarr to be able to manage it. This is usually done manually by navigating to http://localhost:5055/setup on the Jellyseerr host, logging in with Jellyfin or Plex credentials, and then selecting libraries to monitor. As of this release, automatically initialising Jellyseerr for Plex is not yet supported. Please initialise the Jellyseerr instance manually. For Jellyseerr instances being connected to Jellyfin only, Buildarr can perform this initialisation automatically. To do this, set the following parameters under the jellyfin configuration section, which are required when initialisting a new instance (they are otherwise optional): --- jellyseerr : hostname : \"localhost\" port : 5055 protocol : \"http\" api_key : \"<API key>\" # Required. Check `settings.json` in the config volume to get the value. settings : jellyfin : server_url : \"http://localhost:8096\" # Jellyfin server URL, preferably direct (no proxy). username : \"admin\" # Jellyfin server admin user. password : \"secure-password\" # Jellyfin server admin user password. email_address : \"admin@example.com\" # Jellyfin server admin email address. # Jellyfin media libraries to monitor. # This can be used to change what libraries Jellyseerr monitors, # even after it is initialised. libraries : - \"Shows\" - \"Movies\" - \"Anime\" - \"Anime Movies\" After that, configure and run Buildarr as normal, and setup desired settings for Jellyseerr. For more information on configuring Jellyseerr, see Configuring your Jellyseerr instance . Once you have a complete configuration file, test it against the Jellyseerr instance using buildarr run . The output should contain messages about checking, performing and finishing the initialisation. If no errors were found, congratulations, your Jellyseerr instance is now managed by Buildarr! 2023-04-15 09:44:20,386 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Buildarr version 0.4.2 (log level: INFO)

Prowlarr is a manager/proxy for *Arr application Usenet and Torrent indexers. It handles communication with individual indexers for multiple instances on their behalf from a single client, allowing easier configuration of indexers by only setting them up once, and better management of traffic going to indexers to reduce the risk of running into rate limits. Prowlarr v1.0 and later are the only supported versions at this time. If you are using Prowlarr v0.4 or earlier, please upgrade in order to configure your instances with Buildarr. Installation # When using Buildarr as a standalone application , the Prowlarr plugin can simply be installed using pip : $ pip install buildarr buildarr-prowlarr If you are linking a Prowlarr instance with another Buildarr-configured Sonarr instance, use the sonarr extra to also install a compatible version of the Sonarr plugin. $ pip install buildarr buildarr-prowlarr [ sonarr ] When using Buildarr as a Docker container , the Prowlarr plugin is bundled with the official container ( callum027/buildarr ), so there is no need to install it separately. You can upgrade, or pin the version of the plugin to a specific version, within the container by setting the $BUILDARR_INSTALL_PACKAGES environment variable in the docker run command using --env / -e : -e BUILDARR_INSTALL_PACKAGES = \"buildarr-prowlarr==<version>\" Quick Start # To use the Prowlarr plugin, create a prowlarr block within buildarr.yml , and enter the connection information required for the Buildarr instance to connect to the Prowlarr instance you'd like to manage. From version 1.0 onwards, Prowlarr enables authentication by default, preventing Buildarr from automatically retrieving the API key. If authentication is enabled on your Prowlarr configuration, manually retrieve the API key for Prowlarr by copying it from Settings -> General -> Security -> API Key, and pasting it into the configuration file as shown below. --- buildarr : watch_config : true prowlarr : hostname : \"localhost\" # Defaults to `prowlarr`, or the instance name for instance-specific configs. port : 9696 # Defaults to 9696. protocol : \"http\" # Defaults to `http`. api_key : \"...\" # Required if authentication is enabled. Auto-fetch if authentication is disabled. Buildarr won't modify anything yet since no configuration has been defined, but you are able to test if Buildarr is able to connect to and authenticate with the Prowlarr instance. Try a buildarr run . If the output is similar to the below output, Buildarr was able to connect to your Prowlarr instance. 2023-03-29 20:39:50,856 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Buildarr version 0.4.0 (log level: INFO) 2023-03-29 20:39:50,856 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Loading configuration file '/config/buildarr.yml' 2023-03-29 20:39:50,872 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished loading configuration file 2023-03-29 20:39:50,874 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Loaded plugins: prowlarr (0.1.0) 2023-03-29 20:39:50,875 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Loading instance configurations 2023-03-29 20:39:50,877 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished loading instance configurations 2023-03-29 20:39:50,877 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Running with plugins: prowlarr 2023-03-29 20:39:50,877 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Resolving instance dependencies 2023-03-29 20:39:50,877 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished resolving instance dependencies 2023-03-29 20:39:50,877 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Loading secrets file from '/config/secrets.json' 2023-03-29 20:39:50,886 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished loading secrets file 2023-03-29 20:39:50,886 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <prowlarr> (default) Checking secrets 2023-03-29 20:39:50,912 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <prowlarr> (default) Connection test successful using cached secrets 2023-03-29 20:39:50,912 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <prowlarr> (default) Finished checking secrets 2023-03-29 20:39:50,912 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Saving updated secrets file to '/config/secrets.json' 2023-03-29 20:39:50,914 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished saving updated secrets file 2023-03-29 20:39:50,914 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Updating configuration on remote instances 2023-03-29 20:39:50,914 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <prowlarr> (default) Getting remote configuration 2023-03-29 20:39:51,406 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <prowlarr> (default) Finished getting remote configuration 2023-03-29 20:39:51,463 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <prowlarr> (default) Updating remote configuration 2023-03-29 20:39:52,019 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <prowlarr> (default) Remote configuration is up to date 2023-03-29 20:39:52,019 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] <prowlarr> (default) Finished updating remote configuration 2023-03-29 20:39:52,019 buildarr:1 buildarr.cli.run [INFO] Finished updating configuration on remote instances Configuring your Buildarr instance # The following sections cover comprehensive configuration of a Prowlarr instance.

Sonarr is a PVR application which downloads, renames and manages the lifecycle of TV shows in your media library. It is capable of scanning for higher quality versions of your media and automatically upgrading them when a suitable version is available. Currently, Sonarr V3 is the only supported version. Sonarr V4 support is planned for the future. Installation # From version 0.4.0 onwards, the Buildarr Sonarr plugin is now an independent package, developed separately from the core Buildarr package. When using Buildarr as a standalone application , it can simply be installed using pip : $ pip install buildarr buildarr-sonarr When using Buildarr as a Docker container , the Sonarr plugin is still bundled in the official container ( callum027/buildarr ). There is no need to install it separately. You can upgrade, or pin the version of the plugin to a specific version, within the container by setting the $BUILDARR_INSTALL_PACKAGES environment variable in the docker run command using --env / -e : -e BUILDARR_INSTALL_PACKAGES = \"buildarr-sonar==<version>\" In Buildarr version 0.3.0 and earlier, the Sonarr plugin was vendored within the core Buildarr package. On these versions, it is not necessary to install the Sonarr plugin separately. Quick Start # To use the Sonarr plugin, create a sonarr block within buildarr.yml , and enter the connection information required for the Buildarr instance to connect to the Sonarr instance you'd like to manage.

2023-04-16 # This updates the Sonarr plugin so that it is compatible with Buildarr v0.5.0 . Other changes to the Sonarr plugin for this release include: Fix a bug where Sonarr instance configuration dumping was broken due to trying to use a Buildarr configuration value that was not loaded Improve support for deleting resources with delete_unmanaged , by using the new delete_remote API function Remove the sonarr.tags.delete_unused attribute (for deleting Sonarr tags not used in Buildarr), as it was unimplemented and Sonarr automatically cleans up unused tags anyway Changed # Update plugin to newer Buildarr API standards ( #11 ) v0.4.1 - 2023-04-08 # This is a bugfix release that addresses a number of issues that one might encounter when deploying a Sonarr instance for the first time, or linking a Sonarr instance with a Prowlarr instance using the new Prowlarr plugin for Buildarr . Add mutual exclusion handling for the category and directory attributes for Transmission download clients Rename the indexer_priority attribute on indexers to priority (with an alias available for backwards compatibility) Remove the anime_standard_format_search attribute from the common indexer interface, and add it to the specific indexer types that implement it Fix a large number of indexer parsing bugs Torznab indexers are now confirmed to load correctly from remote Sonarr instances (by testing the Torznab indexer Prowlarr creates) Fix updating delay profiles on brand new Sonarr installations Fix updating Media Management naming configuration Fix an issue where UI settings updating was not idempotent Changed # Fix bugs from integration tests ( #4 ) v0.4.0 - 2023-03-31 # This is the first release of the Buildarr Sonarr plugin as an independent package. As major strides have been taken to stabilise the plugin API, the Sonarr plugin for Buildarr has been forked into a separate package, buildarr-sonarr . From Buildarr version 0.4.0 onwards, application plugins are no longer bundled. The Docker container still bundles the Sonarr plugin for ease of use, but when upgrading an existing standalone installation of Buildarr, the Sonarr plugin package will need to be installed using pip . $ pip install buildarr-sonarr This will allow the Sonarr plugin to deliver releases independently of the base Buildarr package, allowing for more rapid releases of both packages, while ensuring compability between Buildarr and its plugins through plugin version pinning of the Buildarr base package. A number of other features and bugfixes have been added in this release of the Sonarr plugin: Add support for dry runs in Buildarr ad-hoc runs, for testing configuration changes against live instances without modifying them Add support for automatic generation of Docker Compose files from Buildarr configuration files using the buildarr compose command Improve validation to output easier-to-read error messages in some cases Refactor logging to use the new logging API for Buildarr v0.4.0 onwards Added # Add the --dry-run option to buildarr run ( buildarr/buildarr#56 ) Add instance-specific configs to global state and fix Sonarr dry-run bug ( buildarr/buildarr#59 ) Add the buildarr test-config command ( buildarr/buildarr#60 ) Add --secrets-file option to daemon and run modes ( buildarr/buildarr#67 ) Add the buildarr compose command ( buildarr/buildarr#73 ) Reintroduce buildarr.__version__ and use it internally ( buildarr/buildarr#75 ) Add version attribute to plugin metadata object ( buildarr/buildarr#78 ) Changed # Convert most root validators to attribute-specific validators ( buildarr/buildarr#54 ) Remove unused code and fix pre-commit job ( buildarr/buildarr#58 ) Enable validating default config/secrets attribute values ( buildarr/buildarr#63 ) Reduce usage of initialize.js endpoints ( buildarr/buildarr#66 ) Refactor logging infrastructure ( buildarr/buildarr#68 ) Relax dependency version requirements ( buildarr/buildarr#69 ) Improve and add missing docs for new features ( buildarr/buildarr#70 ) Evaluate local paths relative to the config file ( buildarr/buildarr#71 ) Add temporary ignore for watchdog.Observer type hint ( buildarr/buildarr#72 ) Fork the Sonarr plugin into its own package ( #1 ) v0.3.0 - 2023-03-15 # This is a feature and bugfix release that extends the groundwork laid in the previous version for making Buildarr more usable, and future-proof for the planned new plugins. A major bug where running Buildarr when secrets.json does not exist would result in an error, even if valid instance credentials were found, has been fixed. This would have prevented many people from trying out Buildarr, and for this I would like to apologise. In the future automated unit tests are planned, and major refactors of the Buildarr codebase are now less likely to happen as a result of development, so bugs like this should not happen as often in the future. The major new feature this release introduces is instance linking: the ability to define relationships between two instances. Most of the work went into the internal implementation to make it possible to use in plugins, but one use case within the Sonarr plugin itself is now supported: Sonarr instances using another Sonarr instance as an import list, via the new instance_name attribute. When using this attribute, Buildarr will automatically fill in the API key attribute so you don't have to, and instead of using IDs to reference quality profiles/language profiles/tags in the source instance, names can now be used: sonarr : instances : sonarr-hd : hostname : \"localhost\" port : 8989 sonarr-4k : hostname : \"localhost\" port : 8990 settings : import_lists : definitions : Sonarr (HD) : type : \"sonarr\" # Global import list options. root_folder : \"/path/to/videos\" quality_profile : \"4K\" language_profile : \"English\" # Sonarr import list-specific options. full_url : \"http://sonarr:8989\" instance_name : \"sonarr-hd\" source_quality_profiles : - \"HD/SD\" source_language_profiles : - \"English\" source_tags : - \"shows\" When instance links are made, Buildarr automatically adjusts the order of execution such that the target instance is always processed before the instance linking to the target. This ensures the state of the target instance is consistent when they are both updated to establish the link. A number of other improvements and bugfixes were made, such as: Fix configuration validation to allow local and non-qualified domains on all URL-type attributes (fixes localhost API URL references) Rename the following Sonarr import list attributes (and retain the old names as aliases to ensure backwards compatibility): source_quality_profile_ids renamed to source_quality_profiles source_language_profile_ids renamed to source_language_profiles source_tag_ids renamed to source_tags Fix reading the $BUILDARR_LOG_LEVEL environment variable to be case-insensitive Clean up runtime state after individual update runs in daemon mode, to ensure no state leakage into subsequent runs Add a new buildarr.request_timeout configuration attribute for adjusting API request timeouts (the default is 30 seconds) Improve Sonarr quality definition min and max validation so that 400 is also a valid value for max , and enforce min - max value difference constraints Major internal code refactor through the introduction of Ruff to the development pipeline, fixing a large number of minor code quality issues Changed # Fix fetching new instance secrets ( buildarr/buildarr#44 ) Accept local and non-qualified domain names in URLs ( buildarr/buildarr#46 ) Add instance referencing and dependency resolution ( buildarr/buildarr#47 ) Replace isort and Flake8 with Ruff and reformat source files ( buildarr/buildarr#49 ) v0.2.0 - 2023-02-23 # This is a feature release that comprehensively refactors the internal structure of Buildarr and the plugin API, and introduces a new, formally defined global state architecture that Buildarr and plugins can utilise. These changes improve maintainability of the codebase, allow for more accurate type validation of global state objects, make the plugin API easier to understand for developers, and pave the way for planned new features such as configuring instance-to-instance links within Buildarr. This release also introduces connection testing of cached and auto-retrieved instance secrets, to ensure Buildarr can communicate and authenticate with instances before it tries to update them. A handful of bugs were fixed, including but not limited to: Work around a parsing bug in Pydantic that causes Buildarr to error out when specifying Sonarr instance API keys in the Buildarr configuration More accurate resource type detection eliminating the chance of parsing errors for Sonarr import list, indexer, download client and connection definitions Set better constraints on some Sonarr configuration attributes: To handle suboptimal configuration (e.g. ignore duplicate elements) To reject invalid configuration (e.g. require at least one recipient e-mail address on Mailgun and Sendgrid connection types) Added # Implement testing of cached and fetched instance secrets ( buildarr/buildarr#32 ) Refactor the internals of Buildarr to improve maintainability ( buildarr/buildarr#30 ) Changed # Convert Password and SonarrApiKey to subclasses of SecretStr ( buildarr/buildarr#34 ) Fix CLI exception class inheritance ( buildarr/buildarr#35 ) Use discriminated unions to accurately determine resource type ( buildarr/buildarr#36 ) Change log types of some TRaSH logs to INFO ( buildarr/buildarr#37 ) Set better constraints on Sonarr configuration attributes ( buildarr/buildarr#38 ) v0.1.2 - 2023-02-20 # This is a bugfix release that fixes updates of certain types of Sonarr instance configuration, improving usability of the Sonarr plugin. The following types of Sonarr instance configuration have had bugfixes and improvements made, and are confirmed to work without errors: Media Management Ensure that minimum_free_space is set to a minimum of 100 MB Fix unmonitor_deleted_episodes so that it is now checked and updated by Buildarr Add a delete_unmanaged_root_folders option to allow Buildarr to delete undefined root folders (disabled by default) Improve other configuration constraints so that it more closely matches Sonarr Fix a minor logging bug in root folder updates Profiles Quality Profiles / Language Profiles Improve attribute constraints e.g. ensure duplicate quality values cannot be defined, enforce upgrade_until being required when allow_upgrades is True Fix conversion between Buildarr and Sonarr configuration state so that no errors occur when upgrades are disabled Internal refactor to make the code easier to understand Delay Profiles - Confirmed to work properly as of v0.1.1 (and likely v0.1.0 ) Release Profiles Fix bug introduced in v0.1.1 where internal validation is not done on release profiles downloaded from TRaSH-Guides, resulting in preferred word lists being updated on each run, and potential errors not being caught if there are invalid values in the profile Internal refactor to simplify implementation Quality Fix bug introduced in v0.1.1 where internal validation is not done on quality profiles downloaded from TRaSH-Guides, resulting in potential errors not being caught if there are invalid values in the profile Metadata - Confirmed to work properly as of v0.1.1 (and likely v0.1.0 ) Small logging bug fixed where it was ambiguous which metadata type was being modified on update Tags - Confirmed to work properly as of v0.1.1 (and likely v0.1.0 ) General Improve behaviour when setting an authentication username and password so that configuration updates are idempotent when authentication is disabled Fix setting a proxy password Fix setting backup intervals and retentions so that it is no longer possible to set a value not supported by Sonarr Incorrect syntax in some examples in the documentation were also found and fixed.

The Docker container still bundles the Sonarr plugin for ease of use, but when upgrading an existing standalone installation of Buildarr, the Sonarr plugin package will need to be installed using pip . $ pip install buildarr-sonarr This will allow the Sonarr plugin to deliver releases independently of the base Buildarr package, allowing for more rapid releases of both packages, while ensuring compability between Buildarr and its plugins through plugin version pinning of the Buildarr base package. A number of other features and bugfixes have been added in this release of the Sonarr plugin: Add support for dry runs in Buildarr ad-hoc runs, for testing configuration changes against live instances without modifying them Add support for automatic generation of Docker Compose files from Buildarr configuration files using the buildarr compose command Improve validation to output easier-to-read error messages in some cases Refactor logging to use the new logging API for Buildarr v0.4.0 onwards","title":"v0.4.0 - 2023-03-31"},{"location":"plugins/sonarr/release-notes/#added","text":"Add the --dry-run option to buildarr run ( buildarr/buildarr#56 ) Add instance-specific configs to global state and fix Sonarr dry-run bug ( buildarr/buildarr#59 ) Add the buildarr test-config command ( buildarr/buildarr#60 ) Add --secrets-file option to daemon and run modes ( buildarr/buildarr#67 ) Add the buildarr compose command ( buildarr/buildarr#73 ) Reintroduce buildarr.__version__ and use it internally ( buildarr/buildarr#75 ) Add version attribute to plugin metadata object ( buildarr/buildarr#78 )","title":"Added"},{"location":"plugins/sonarr/release-notes/#changed_2","text":"Convert most root validators to attribute-specific validators ( buildarr/buildarr#54 ) Remove unused code and fix pre-commit job ( buildarr/buildarr#58 ) Enable validating default config/secrets attribute values ( buildarr/buildarr#63 ) Reduce usage of initialize.js endpoints ( buildarr/buildarr#66 ) Refactor logging infrastructure ( buildarr/buildarr#68 ) Relax dependency version requirements ( buildarr/buildarr#69 ) Improve and add missing docs for new features ( buildarr/buildarr#70 ) Evaluate local paths relative to the config file ( buildarr/buildarr#71 ) Add temporary ignore for watchdog.Observer type hint ( buildarr/buildarr#72 ) Fork the Sonarr plugin into its own package ( #1 )","title":"Changed"},{"location":"plugins/sonarr/release-notes/#v030-2023-03-15","text":"This is a feature and bugfix release that extends the groundwork laid in the previous version for making Buildarr more usable, and future-proof for the planned new plugins. A major bug where running Buildarr when secrets.json does not exist would result in an error, even if valid instance credentials were found, has been fixed. This would have prevented many people from trying out Buildarr, and for this I would like to apologise. In the future automated unit tests are planned, and major refactors of the Buildarr codebase are now less likely to happen as a result of development, so bugs like this should not happen as often in the future. The major new feature this release introduces is instance linking: the ability to define relationships between two instances. Most of the work went into the internal implementation to make it possible to use in plugins, but one use case within the Sonarr plugin itself is now supported: Sonarr instances using another Sonarr instance as an import list, via the new instance_name attribute. When using this attribute, Buildarr will automatically fill in the API key attribute so you don't have to, and instead of using IDs to reference quality profiles/language profiles/tags in the source instance, names can now be used: sonarr : instances : sonarr-hd : hostname : \"localhost\" port : 8989 sonarr-4k : hostname : \"localhost\" port : 8990 settings : import_lists : definitions : Sonarr (HD) : type : \"sonarr\" # Global import list options. root_folder : \"/path/to/videos\" quality_profile : \"4K\" language_profile : \"English\" # Sonarr import list-specific options. full_url : \"http://sonarr:8989\" instance_name : \"sonarr-hd\" source_quality_profiles : - \"HD/SD\" source_language_profiles : - \"English\" source_tags : - \"shows\" When instance links are made, Buildarr automatically adjusts the order of execution such that the target instance is always processed before the instance linking to the target. This ensures the state of the target instance is consistent when they are both updated to establish the link. A number of other improvements and bugfixes were made, such as: Fix configuration validation to allow local and non-qualified domains on all URL-type attributes (fixes localhost API URL references) Rename the following Sonarr import list attributes (and retain the old names as aliases to ensure backwards compatibility): source_quality_profile_ids renamed to source_quality_profiles source_language_profile_ids renamed to source_language_profiles source_tag_ids renamed to source_tags Fix reading the $BUILDARR_LOG_LEVEL environment variable to be case-insensitive Clean up runtime state after individual update runs in daemon mode, to ensure no state leakage into subsequent runs Add a new buildarr.request_timeout configuration attribute for adjusting API request timeouts (the default is 30 seconds) Improve Sonarr quality definition min and max validation so that 400 is also a valid value for max , and enforce min - max value difference constraints Major internal code refactor through the introduction of Ruff to the development pipeline, fixing a large number of minor code quality issues","title":"v0.3.0 - 2023-03-15"},{"location":"plugins/sonarr/release-notes/#changed_3","text":"Fix fetching new instance secrets ( buildarr/buildarr#44 ) Accept local and non-qualified domain names in URLs ( buildarr/buildarr#46 ) Add instance referencing and dependency resolution ( buildarr/buildarr#47 ) Replace isort and Flake8 with Ruff and reformat source files ( buildarr/buildarr#49 )","title":"Changed"},{"location":"plugins/sonarr/release-notes/#v020-2023-02-23","text":"This is a feature release that comprehensively refactors the internal structure of Buildarr and the plugin API, and introduces a new, formally defined global state architecture that Buildarr and plugins can utilise.

This release also introduces connection testing of cached and auto-retrieved instance secrets, to ensure Buildarr can communicate and authenticate with instances before it tries to update them. A handful of bugs were fixed, including but not limited to: Work around a parsing bug in Pydantic that causes Buildarr to error out when specifying Sonarr instance API keys in the Buildarr configuration More accurate resource type detection eliminating the chance of parsing errors for Sonarr import list, indexer, download client and connection definitions Set better constraints on some Sonarr configuration attributes: To handle suboptimal configuration (e.g. ignore duplicate elements) To reject invalid configuration (e.g. require at least one recipient e-mail address on Mailgun and Sendgrid connection types)","title":"v0.2.0 - 2023-02-23"},{"location":"plugins/sonarr/release-notes/#added_1","text":"Implement testing of cached and fetched instance secrets ( buildarr/buildarr#32 ) Refactor the internals of Buildarr to improve maintainability ( buildarr/buildarr#30 )","title":"Added"},{"location":"plugins/sonarr/release-notes/#changed_4","text":"Convert Password and SonarrApiKey to subclasses of SecretStr ( buildarr/buildarr#34 ) Fix CLI exception class inheritance ( buildarr/buildarr#35 ) Use discriminated unions to accurately determine resource type ( buildarr/buildarr#36 ) Change log types of some TRaSH logs to INFO ( buildarr/buildarr#37 ) Set better constraints on Sonarr configuration attributes ( buildarr/buildarr#38 )","title":"Changed"},{"location":"plugins/sonarr/release-notes/#v012-2023-02-20","text":"This is a bugfix release that fixes updates of certain types of Sonarr instance configuration, improving usability of the Sonarr plugin.
